					<h3>Welcome!</h3>
					<p>You seem to have stumbled upon the tremendous and 
					wonderful UMW Course Ratings Website. Shall we get onto
					business now? Excellent, let's begin:</p>
					
					<p>Don't you just hate it when you take a course and 
					expect one thing, but receive a completely different 
					experience? Well, you are in luck my dear sir and/or
					madam, for we designed this website for 
					students just like you! This website allows current 
					UMW students and alumni to rate the courses that they've
					taken or are currently enrolled in. We strive to
					provide our users with the most realistic expectations
					for the courses offered here at UMW. You are also able to post 
					your own comments and feedback about courses, professors, 
					and Trinkle itself!.</p>
